Attention: <%= name.capitalize %>'s Parents

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name.capitalize %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
<%= name.capitalize %>'s Toy Order
=================

<% if behavior == 'naughty' -%>
$<%= toy_price.to_s %>  Defective toy
<% else -%>
<% toys.each do |toy| -%>
<% if toy == 'Kaleidoscope' && toy_price == 1_000 -%>
$<%= '0' %>     <%= toy %> (out of stock)
<% elsif toy == 'Kaleidoscope' -%>
$<%= '0' %>    <%= toy %> (out of stock)
<% else -%>
$<%= toy_price.to_s %>  <%= toy %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>

$<%= subtotal %>  Subtotal
$<%= tax %>   HST
====
$<%= total %>  Total

Your total comes to $<%= total %>. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7. I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name.capitalize %>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
